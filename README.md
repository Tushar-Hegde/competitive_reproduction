This code was built to try and simulate evolution with elementary parameters
There are Blue plants, which spread seeds to 2 neighbouring spaces along with leaving one where they are,
and there are Red plants, which spread seeds to 4 neighbouring spaces along with leaving one where they are.
There are mutation parameters, specifying how much % of red seeds turn blue and vice versa.
It leads to some really cool observations

The above is a run with no mutations, where the Red plants outcompete the Blue plants for limited spaces


[ev (1).pdf](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/16735245/ev.1.pdf)

The above is a run where both the plants mutate to each other.
It is interesting to note that regardless of starting conditions, they seem to end up around the same ratio of Blue/Red plants
